These are possibly the greatest sweets ever, they combine the perfectly simple taste and texture of flavoured rice paper with the zangy, explosive fruit sherbet! They melt on your tongue and we don't know anybody that doesn't like these, and lets be honest what isn't to like?! So succulently flavourful, be careful not to scoff the whole lot at one time... it's a mistake everyone has made",
